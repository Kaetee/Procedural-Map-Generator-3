Continuation of original Java map generator.

We were given the option to make any project we're interested in 5th year, so I used that as an opportunity to properly research and teach about procedural map generation. This is further continuation of that 5th year project. Might add the teaching materials I wrote.

2019.

Cloned from my bitbucket repository.
