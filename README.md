Continuation of original Java map generator.

We were given the option to make any project we're interested in 5th year, so I used that as an opportunity to properly research and teach about procedural map generation. This is further continuation of that 5th year project. Might add the teaching materials I wrote.

2019.

Cloned from my bitbucket repository.

TO DO: Add a "Trim" function that removes landmasses wioth too low a land-neighbour count. Can be used before each increase in size to make more realistic looking land (less tiny islands everywhere). A similar effect could be achieved by scaling the land spread threshold and chance up, but that would seriously impact performance as the same landsize would take many more iterations to create.
